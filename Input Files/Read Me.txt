This folder is designed to hold input templates and example input files to be used in unit tests.

File List (I tried uploading the JSON files directly but the updload altered their format for some reason, convert all files to .json before using):
validInput - a file that should create valid user defined objects. Note that dRateNom may be calculated
missingRateReal - a file that should create valid used defined objects but requires the code to generate the real discount rate
missingRateNom - a file that should create valid used defined objects but requires the code to generate the real discount rate
